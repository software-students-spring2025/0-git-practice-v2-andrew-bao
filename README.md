Recently, an AI startup Deepseek released an LLM that challenged the current established giants in AI like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.
Normally a release like this would be major but not groundbreaking but the difference here is Deepseek is relatively small project spearheaded
as a side project by a hedgefund costing less than 6 million dollars. This is a stark contrast to the billions in funding, easy access to the best hardware, 
and years of prior experience. A lot of people are calling this a "Sputnik moment" as it is similar to when the Soviet Union launched the first unmanned spacecraft
in space all of a sudden causing the Western world to panic and scramble. I think it also calls in question the state of the AI bubble. Are these companies really
deserving of their current valuations? Are they just going down an inefficient path or is there something more going on?

I think that the advent of Deepseek is a step towards revolutionizing cost efficiency within the widely expensive industry of AI and LLMs. With increased competition on American companies, Deepseek seeks to make the LLM industry more accessible at a global scale, targeting audiences outside of the United States, while also boasting high performances with a fraction of the cost. This increase competition will likely lead to an increase in productivity of innovation and new discoveries within the field of AI, potentially bringing us to the brink of the new pinnacle of LLMs of the modern era.
